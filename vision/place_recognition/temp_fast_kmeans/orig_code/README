#
# Installation
#
You need to update the Makefile if you are on a 64bit machine (you will see it). and to give the correct
$MATLABDIR if you want to use matlab. Then call "make clean all"

Or within Matlab, using mex:
mex -c -O mpi_kmeans.cxx
mex -O mpi_kmeans_mex.cxx mpi_kmeans.o
mex -O mpi_assign.cxx mpi_kmeans.o

If you are fine with single precision or in need for more mem you can compile with -DINPUT_TYPE=2

#
# Use
#
Matlab:
Try "help mpi_kmeans_mex" in a matlab shell. This will also give an example

Python: 
Just run ./mpi_kmeans.py for an example.
