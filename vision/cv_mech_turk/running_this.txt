//SET UP ROS (assuming you've previously downlaoded it)
0.1. svn up in  .../ros/ros  and .../ros/ros-pkg  just to be sure.
0.2. in .../ros/ros, rosmake roscpp_demo (that  will rebuild all kinds of crap hat you might need)

//TO GET THE NODE RUNNING:
  //  -- Do everything all at once:
roslaunch mt.launch   [this will run roscore, start the camera with dc1394 and then run ./cv_mturk image:=dcam/image

  //  -- Do it piece by piece:
1 RUNNING THE MASTER NDOE: 
	run roscore.  You just open a window and type roscore. [This is the master node]
2 RUNNING A 1394 CAMERA: 
	Open another window.

   2.1. Type "roscd dcam".
     2.1a. If not made, then make it by typing: rosmake. 
   2.2. Then run camera capture by: ./bin/dcam [This reads from the camera and publishes images]
   2.3 IF THE CAMERA BOMBS OUT WITH ERRORS, TRY SETTING PERMISSIONS
	  [ You might have to: sudo chmod 666 /dev  and /dev/video1394 ]


3 RUNNING THE MTURK NODE: 
	roscd cv_mech_turk   [If you svn up in ros-pkg, you will get this new package]

   3.1. IF YOU NEED TO MAKE THE NODE: rosmake
     3.1a. If things don't work, you might have to try "rosapt-get cv_view" and or struggle with loading any number of dependencies and lots of make cleans in the appropriate packages.  Once it builds:
   3.2 RUN THE NODE: ./cv_mturk image:=dcam/image     [This will run the camera viewer]

4 OTHER NEEDED FILES
    When you type "m", cv_mturk will invoke: submit_img.py which in turn depends on:
	* id_rsa_SIU  [These are access keys]
	* id_rsa_SIU.pub
	* Needs an image storage subdirectory called: "/images"

5 put id_rsa_SIU and id_rsa_SIU.pub in src/.  Note: id_rsa_SIU need to have permission 600 for scp and subsequent http request to work properly.
