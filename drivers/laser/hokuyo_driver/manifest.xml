  <description brief="A standalone hokuyo driver">
    A standalone driver for SCIP2.0-compliant Hokuyo laser devices
    pulled from player distribution and modified heavily.  It is
    isolated in its own package since it must be licensed under the
    LGPL.  Eventually this may be merged back with player, at which
    point this package would likely be removed.
