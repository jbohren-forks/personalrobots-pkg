  Just like in the movie, Megamaid can either vacuum up information (other 
  software frameworks refer to this as "logging") or it can reverse directions
  and blow all the data back where it came from (otherwise known as "playback").

  The executables you need are in the "bin" directory of this package. Launch
  them without any parameters to see a syntax reference.

  If the reference still doesn't make sense, please go watch the Spaceballs 
  movie again.
