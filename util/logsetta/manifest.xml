    Like the famed Rosetta stone of ages past, the logsetta package will
    contain translators to/from every imaginable log file format.
    
    But hey, you have to start somewhere. Currently all it can do is write
    CARMEN log files. So you can use the "megamaid" package to make vacuum bags
    of your experiment, then play them back (also through "megamaid") while the
    CARMEN logger is running to do the translation.
